# Stereo Matching Experiment

Learning project of classic stereo matching algorithms. Implementation done in PyTorch, CUDA and C++.

Aproaches:

* Winner takes all
* Dynamic Programming
* Semiglobal matching

Besides the references for stereo matching algorithms, it also servers as example of a PyTorch + C++ + CUDA + skbuild project.

**Note**: The algorithms aren't differentiable.
